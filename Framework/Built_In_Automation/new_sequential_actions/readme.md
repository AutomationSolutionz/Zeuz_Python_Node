Objective: 

Merge sequential actions from Selenium, Appium, and REST into one project that shares much of their common functions.

Status: 

Just begun. sequential_actions.py created and working

Challenges:

Can easily call functions the USER wants to execute, but have not found a solution to call module specific functions that the common functions need to call.
