1. We don't properly check for login info. So it will say successfully logged in when you don't even enter any details.
2. I would like a better Settings page. I created an HTML for it, just needs to integrated. And the logout should be in Options and have a dedicated Logout option when you mouse right click on the extension
3. I need to move the logout feature to the Settings page. So when you click on the extension to disable it, instead of logging out, it should just disable it. If I want to go logout, i should be able to do it from Settings or main Logout option
